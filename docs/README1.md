# The predict page 
#### This feature allows users to predict the page counte of a book based on its other attributes such as genre, page_number, average rating, comprehensionability and genre enticement. The ML model learnt the relationship that existed between those key attributes and predict the page count of the book with 86% accuracy. The layout is seen in the image below with sample input.

The sample above demonstrates how to interact with the machine learning model trained on key attributes to predict a book's page count. Users can select the book's genre from a drop-down list, choose the publication year and rating, and adjust the comprehension difficulty and genre enticement using sliders. Comprehension difficulty refers to how challenging the book is to understand; for example, philosophical, medical, math, or political ideology books are typically more difficult to comprehend and analyze, while children's books or guides such as cookbooks are easier to follow. Genre enticement refers to how engaging and captivating the book is, with some books designed to create suspense and hold the reader's attention, while others are primarily educational. This interactive approach allows users to explore how different factors influence a book's page count.
